## Files/Instructions:
- `autostereograms.ipynb` includes random-dot and tiled autostereogram generation, autostereogram decoding, and animated autostrereograms. Each of these can be interactively ran and tweaked within the Jupyter Notebook.
- `live_autostereogram.py` defines the python program that implements a head-tracked live-perspective autostereogram. It can be run with `python live_autostereogram.py`. Make sure your webcam is accessible. Both the position of your face and the horizontal position of your mouse can be used to change the perspective.
- `live_autostereogram.glsl` defines the fragment shader program that implements the live autostereogram.
